# Estate-Project
Project  inspired from buying and selling real estate website.

## How The Project Work
The project displays two options: the ﬁrst is to sell a property or sell a property. If the user wants to buy a property, it displays some options for how to display the available properties, such as (all properties, the most important properties, displaying properties from the most expensive to the lowest price, displaying the properties from the lowest price) Price to the most expensive, displaying properties according to a speciﬁc price that the user wants, the most recent properties), then he gives some introductory overview of each property according to his choice of the type of display. If he is attracted by a property, he can choose its number to see more details about it, then he is asked if he wants to buy it or not. If he wants to buy it, several ways are offered for him to communicate with those in charge of the site, and he chooses between them. If he chooses to sell a property, he is asked for information about this property, then it is added to the rest of the previous properties and appears with them.
